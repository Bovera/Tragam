# Tragam   
Tragam is short for Translation Program. It allows you to translate md files into tex files, or py files into js files, etc. As a part of the Mecal program, this tool will be useful for the science and engineering students to write their paper.   
> **Note:**   
> 1. The Mecal program hasn't been launched yet. Mecal stands for Mathematical calculation. As a substitution of 3M (Mathematica, Matlab, Maple) for free, it will be a good friend to the science and engineering students. Though Mecal won't be built from scratch, the GUI and expanded Function will make the use of the math modules in Python more efficient and easily.    
> 2. The Tragam program is my first try and you are welcome to join me and criticize. I apologize that it may be useless to you, since I am new to GitHub and have little experience with any computer program.    
## Tragam-md-tex tool   
**Language: Python | Author: Bovera(China) | Last Edit Date: 2021-2-11**   

This tool allows you to translate md files into tex files. Markdown is more convenient than LaTeX when it comes to syntax, but that is exactly where the drawback lies. The low requirement in syntax leads to loose structure, which is bad for your paper. So its important to translate md files into tex files.   
## Tragam-py-js tool   
**Language: ----- | Author: ----- | Last Edit Date: -----**   

This tool allows you to translate py files into js files and html files, which is used more widely. In my assumptions, the Mecal will be build on the basis of browser and like Jupyter Notebook. (That hasn't been decided yet.)
