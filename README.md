# Tragam
Tragam is short for Translation Program. It allows you to translate md files into tex files, or py files into js files, etc.   
> Explanation: Tragam is my first try. I apologize that it may be useless to you, since I am new to GitHub and have little experience with any computer program.
## Tragam-md-tex program
This program allows you to translate md files into tex files. Markdown is more convenient than LaTeX when it comes to syntax, but that is exactly where the drawback lies. The low requirement in syntax leads to loose structure, which is bad for your paper. So its important to translate md files into tex files.
